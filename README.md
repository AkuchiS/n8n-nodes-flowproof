An n8n community node that validates a workflow export **imports cleanly** — before you ship it to a client, publish it, or trust one you downloaded. It catches the exact things that break shared templates on import:

- 🔑 **leaked credentials** embedded in the JSON (must never ship)
- 🧩 **missing / community nodes** not installed on the target instance
- ⬆️ **version drift** (a node exported from a newer n8n than the importer runs)
- 🪢 **broken connections** and structural corruption
- ⚠️ **deprecated nodes & parameters**

**Runs entirely inside your n8n. No API, no network, no credentials — your workflows never leave the instance.**

## Operations
- **Check** — full diagnostic report (`importable`, `fidelity_score`, blockers, manual steps, required community packages, per-issue detail).
- **Verify** — a pass/fail verdict + the blockers, designed to gate a deploy (toggle *Fail Node on NOT-Importable* to stop a run).

## Why trust the verdict
FlowProof's verdicts are arbitrated against a **live n8n import** — in testing against 20 real workflows from 3 sources, the check matched the live importer with **0 mismatches**. This node re-implements that same logic in TypeScript and a CI parity test asserts it agrees with the reference engine on every fixture.

The free CLI version (Python, MIT) lives at <https://github.com/AkuchiS/flowproof>. **FlowProof Pro** goes further: it repairs the workflow and hands you an import-ready file + a content-hashed "FlowProof Checked" certificate + a client-ready handover.

## Install
Community Nodes (self-hosted): **Settings → Community Nodes → Install** → `n8n-nodes-flowproof`.
